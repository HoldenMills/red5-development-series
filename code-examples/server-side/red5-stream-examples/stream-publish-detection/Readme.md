# Stream Publish/Unpublish detection
---


## About
---

This server side application demonstrates how to detect stream publish event outside the Application adapter. You can use this to detect publish start in the context of a Red5 plugin or a separate service runnin within your application.


## Build & Deploy
---

### Build
---

To build this application : open a shell prompt in the application's project directory (where the pom.xml file resides). run the following maven command in your shell -> 

``` 
mvn clean package 

```

The above command will generate a `war` file in the `target` directory inside the project directory. 


### Deploy
---

To deploy the war to red5 pro server :

1. Stop server if it is running.

2. Extract the content of the `war file` to directory by war name. 

> The java war file is simply a `archive file` similar to `zip` format. you can extract it using a archive tool such as [7zip](#http://www.7-zip.org/), [Winrar trial](#http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) etc

3. Copy the folder into `RED5_HOME/webapps/` directory.

4. Start server.



## How To Use Example

TO DO



## Eclipse
---

You can edit the server side code in your eclipse JEE IDE such as Luna, Mars, Neon etc. To import the code into your IDE:

2. Execute maven command `mvn eclipse:eclipse`. This will generate files necessary for eclipse to read the maven project properly.
3. In eclipse go to `File -> Import -> Existing Maven Projects` and click `Next`.
4. Browse and select `the project root` and Click `Finish` to import the project.
